# Outbreak Lab
Author: Kacper Potaczała


## Basic Info
The EXE Version is the best version you can choose because everything is handled, and no installation is needed other than CUDA tools locally. To know what to do, check [here](https://github.com/QG1414/OutbreakLab?tab=readme-ov-file#cuda-information)

To use this version, you have to download the ZIP with the EXE file or installer from this [release](https://github.com/QG1414/OutbreakLab/releases/tag/ExeVersionRelease)

## Usage
To run this app, download the ZIP OutbreakLab.zip from this [release](https://github.com/QG1414/OutbreakLab/releases/tag/VisualVersionRelease) or OutbreakLabInstaller.exe
 * If you download the ZIP, then unpack it. Do not move OutbreakLab.exe or modify the _internal folder, as it might cause the app to not work correctly. Then run OutbreakLab.exe.
 * If you use the installer, then download and run it. Go through the installer wizard, and the app will be installed. Then run OutbreakLab.exe. Do not move it from the folder, and do not modify the _internal folder.

Then the visual app will show up. For the next steps, refer to [VisualVersion] (https://github.com/QG1414/OutbreakLab/tree/VisualVersion?tab=readme-ov-file#usage)

## Visualas and what they do

Visuals are the same as for the Visual Version, and you can check them [here](https://github.com/QG1414/OutbreakLab/tree/VisualVersion?tab=readme-ov-file#visualas-and-what-they-do)

## Cuda set info
When using CUDA, sometimes it cannot be detected on a computer. If this happens, a notification will be displayed and CUDA will be automatically disabled.
Additionally, clicking on Enable CUDA for the first time might cause a slight freeze because some dependencies that need to be installed dynamically will run.

## Important info about this version
This app has no key publishing, so Windows may not want to run it. You can bypass this easily.
Also, because of that, antivirus software might scan the app before running and, in edge cases, even delete it. This is the only drawback of this version.
Also, the first time installing or launching the app may take longer due to dependency loading.

## Requirements
For this app version, you don't need Python or any libraries—just run the installer or run the EXE from the ZIP, and everything should work.
The only exception is CUDA. If CUDA is not working, refer to this [page](https://github.com/QG1414/OutbreakLab/tree/VisualVersion?tab=readme-ov-file#visualas-and-what-they-do)
